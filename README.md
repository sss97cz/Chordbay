## 🛠 Command-line uploader

A small helper script (uploader.sh) can upload plain `.txt` song files to the backend. This section documents usage and examples.

- Input: a directory containing `.txt` song files (one file per song in format: {ArtistName - SongName}).
- Authentication: the script requires an API token (access token).

Usage (uploader.sh -h output):

```
Usage: uploader.sh -t TOKEN [-d DIR]
Options:
  -t TOKEN    API token (required)
  -d DIR      Directory with .txt song files (default: current directory)
  -h          Show this help
Example:
  uploader.sh -t "mytoken" -d ./songs
```

How to obtain a token 
1. Authenticate with the backend to get an access token (example uses the /api/auth/login endpoint):

  -expectes you to have an verifierd account

```bash
curl https://chordbay.eu/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com", "password":"YourPassword"}'
```

The server will respond with JSON containing at least an `accessToken` and `refreshToken`. Example (redacted):

```json
{
  "accessToken": "ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE",
  "refreshToken": "REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

2. Use the access token with uploader.sh:

```bash
./uploader.sh -t ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE -d ./assets
```

Example run and expected output
```
Uploading: Artist1  — Song1
  OK (HTTP 200)
-----
Uploading: Artist2 — Song2
  OK (HTTP 200)
-----
```

Notes and tips
- Default directory: if `-d` is not provided, the script uses the current directory.
- File format: expect plain `.txt` files containing the song text (same format as used for import/export within the app). Keep one song per file.
- Security: do not commit access tokens to version control. Treat access tokens as secrets.
- Troubleshooting: if you get 401/403 responses, verify the token is valid and has not expired. Use the refresh token flow (if available) or re-login to obtain a fresh access token.

## Roadmap ideas

Some possible future improvements:
- Move the project to KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform) for desktop and browser.
- Improve the chord detection algorithm.

If you have suggestions or want to help with any of these, contributions are welcome.
